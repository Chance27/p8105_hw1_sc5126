## Problem 1

**Load dataset**

``` r
library(moderndive)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
data("early_january_weather")
```

**Description of the dataset:**  
The variables in the dataset include origin, year, month, day, hour,
temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure,
visib, time_hour.  
The highest temperature is 57.92 and the lowest temperature is 24.08.
The mean of humidity is 65.4767039 and the mean of visibility is
8.5153352.  
There are 358 rows and 15 columns in the dataset.  
The mean temperature is 39.5821229.  

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_sc5126_files/figure-gfm/plot_prob1-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("scatter_temp_time.png")
```

As the time_hour increases, the temperature shows a generally increasing
trend and the humidity increases as well.

## Problem 2

**Create a data frame**

``` r
df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = vec_numeric > 0,
  vec_char = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("a", "b", "c", "a", "b", "c","a", "b", "c","a"))
)
```

**Take the mean of each variable**

``` r
mean_num = mean(pull(df, vec_numeric))
mean_logical = mean(pull(df, vec_logical))
mean_char = mean(pull(df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_factor = mean(pull(df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

Taking the mean works for the numeric variable and the logical variable,
but it doesnâ€™t work for the character variable and the factor
variable.  

**Convert to numeric variable**

``` r
num_logical = as.numeric(pull(df, vec_logical))
num_char = as.numeric(pull(df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
num_factor = as.numeric(pull(df, vec_factor))
```

The logical and factor variables are converted to numeric type
successfully, while the character variable fails to be converted to be
numeric (or is converted to NAs by coercion). Yes.The mean function can
only be applied to numeric and logical vectors.
